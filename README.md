Yet another discord bot now in Rust ðŸ¦€. (Praise Ferris ðŸ˜Š)

# Features
- User controller color roles
- Starboard (configurable channel and an option to enable/disable it)
- ...

Database support - uses a local Sqlite DB for simple storage of things like colors etc.
Made in Rust so blazingly fast, also very low RAM usage - testing similar bot in Python vs Rust;
The Python version uses about 50MB/out of 250MB assigned to it while the Rust version only used 5MB~
